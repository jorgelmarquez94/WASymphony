        <h2>Symphony</h2>
        <p class="definition">Simphony is a programmable language in our web application, which is compiled through a request to our server, which sends a response according to the code generated by the user. This language has the common elements of most modern languages, such as arrays, cycles, conditionals, variables, functions, special functions, among others.</p>
        <h2>Symphony Objectives</h2>
        <p>Symphony aims to be a simple, in English language so that anyone can learn the basic logic of programming, giving them the necessary knowledge to explore for themselves more mature languages such as Python. The most notable feature of Simphony is that it allows music lovers to learn in a more intuitive way.</p>
        <h2>Symphony Vision</h2>
        <p>Our vision for the future of our project is that Mexico has the necessary resources to promote teaching or self-learning of programming. Our project was designed to be used by people who do not necessarily have notions about programming, but who do seek to give them an opportunity to learn their basic concepts, and this tool can be easily adapted in school settings.</p>
